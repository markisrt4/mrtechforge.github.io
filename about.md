  <h2>About Mark</h2>
  <p>
    My background spans embedded systems, networking, and software development — but what I enjoy most is
    translating complex tech into something you can actually use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether we’re securing a home network, setting up a managed phone/text line, or helping a small group adopt better
    digital habits, the goal is the same: <strong>confidence through understanding</strong>.

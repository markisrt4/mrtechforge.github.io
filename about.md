      <p class="about-lead">
        I’m an engineer who genuinely enjoys building relationships and helping people understand the technology they rely on.
        One of my favorite moments is watching someone hit that <em>“a-ha”</em> point — when a complex technical idea suddenly
        clicks and feels approachable.
      </p>

      <p class="about-lead">
        That ability to translate complicated systems into plain, human language is at the heart of everything I build at
        <strong class="about-brand">M.R. TechForge</strong>.

      How I think about technology
    </h2>
    <p>
      I build systems that are <strong>clear, dependable, and quietly useful</strong>.
      Not flashy. Not bloated. Just technology that works the way you expect it to — (and explains itself along the way).
    </p>
    <p>
      Good engineering doesn’t just solve problems; it builds confidence.
      If a system only makes sense to its creator, it’s unfinished.
    </p>
  </div>

      The why
    </h2>
    <p>
      I’ve spent years working with software, hardware, and infrastructure — from code and automation to devices operating on real networks
      in real environments.
    </p>

    <p class="about-quote">
      Tools that were powerful, but difficult to trust.
      Solutions that solved one problem while introducing unnecessary complexity.
      Systems that required expertise just to understand what they were doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      M.R. TechForge started as a response to that frustration.
      My goal is always to <strong>reduce cognitive load</strong>, not add to it — to design systems that communicate clearly,
      behave predictably, and respect the people using them.
    </p>
  </div>

      What I build
    </h2>
    <p>
      M.R. TechForge isn’t an agency or a product factory. It’s a small, focused workshop where I build things end-to-end,
      with clarity and responsibility in mind.
    </p>

    <ul class="about-list">
      <li>Purpose-built software tools</li>
      <li>Secure, privacy-respecting communication systems</li>
      <li>NFC-driven physical + digital interactions</li>
      <li>Self-hosted and locally controlled infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="about-muted">
      Everything is built with real people in mind — not just technical requirements.
    </p>
  </div>

      Teaching, learning, and the next generation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Teaching is one of the most rewarding parts of what I do.
      I enjoy helping people — technical or not — understand how systems work, how to use them safely,
      and how to make informed decisions online.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m especially excited about teaching the <strong>next generation of coders</strong>, engineers, and problem-solvers —
      and helping others build good online habits around <strong>privacy</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, and digital responsibility.

      How I work
    </h2>
    <ul class="about-principles">
      <li><strong>Clarity beats cleverness</strong> — understanding builds trust</li>
      <li><strong>Reliability beats novelty</strong> — boring systems last longer</li>
      <li><strong>Simple isn’t shallow</strong> — clarity takes real effort</li>
      <li><strong>Systems should explain themselves</strong> — good design leaves breadcrumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="about-muted">
      If something feels fragile, opaque, or over-engineered, it usually means there’s more thinking to do.

      A human moment
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some of my best work happens in quiet moments — helping someone untangle a technical problem, teaching a concept until it clicks,
      or standing still for a minute, coffee in hand, thinking through a system from first principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re here because you value clarity, thoughtful engineering, or working with someone who takes the time to explain things well,
      you’re in the right place.

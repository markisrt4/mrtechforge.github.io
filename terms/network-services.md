## Service Terms & Expectations

These terms describe how M.R. TechForge (“MRTF”) provides Secure Network Services and what clients can reasonably expect.

### 1. Best-Effort Services
All services are provided on a best-effort basis. MRTF does not guarantee uninterrupted operation, specific performance outcomes, or immunity from failures, outages, or security incidents.

### 2. No Emergency or 24/7 Support by Default
Unless explicitly agreed in writing, MRTF does not provide emergency response or 24/7 on-call support. Managed Network Care reflects ongoing assistance and guidance, not guaranteed response times.

### 3. No Data Custody
MRTF does not store customer data, access files, or retain encryption keys. All data ownership and responsibility remains with the client.

### 4. Hardware & Account Responsibility
Clients are responsible for their hardware, ISP services, accounts, and credentials. MRTF may recommend or assist with configuration but does not assume ownership of third-party equipment or services.

### 5. Recovery & Security Limitations
While MRTF designs systems with recoverability and safer defaults in mind, no system is immune to failure, misuse, or compromise. Data recovery and restoration cannot be guaranteed.

### 6. Scope Changes
Changes beyond the originally agreed scope may require additional approval or pricing. MRTF will communicate clearly before performing out-of-scope work.

### 7. Questions
If you have questions about these terms, please contact M.R. TechForge before engaging services.

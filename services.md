> **Empower people with the knowledge and tools to use technology safely, clearly, and confidently.**

## 🏠 Home-Based & Online Technology Solutions  

Not everyone wants to be their own IT department. That’s where we come in.

We provide **patient, practical support** for technology at home or online:

- Setup and configuration of personal computers, devices, and home networks  
- Guidance on choosing privacy-respecting tools and services  
- Help taming cluttered tech: accounts, logins, backups, email, and more  
- Remote consultations for troubleshooting day-to-day issues  

Our approach is **hands-on and non-judgmental**.  
You don’t need to “speak tech” — that’s our job.

- **Security & access** – safer account practices, password managers, and account cleanup

## 💻 Coding 101 – Teaching the Next Generation  

We’re passionate about helping the next generation understand how technology works — not just how to tap it.

Our **Coding 101** offerings (for kids, teens, and motivated adults) focus on:

- Beginner-friendly programming lessons with an emphasis on **Python**  
- Approachable explanations of core concepts (logic, variables, loops, functions)  
- Hands-on projects that make code feel **useful and fun**, not intimidating  
- Flexible formats: one-on-one, small group, or partner-hosted classes (churches, libraries, community centers)

The goal isn’t to turn everyone into a professional developer overnight —  
it’s to **build confidence**, curiosity, and problem-solving skills that last.

## 📘 Technical Documentation & Product Testing  

Well-designed tech still fails if the user experience is confusing.  
That’s why documentation and testing matter.

We help bridge the gap between the people who **build** technology and the people who **use** it through:

- **Documentation Overhaul** – rewriting confusing manuals or procedures into clear, friendly, accurate content  
- **Usability & Product Testing** – trying products like real users would and noting gaps in clarity or behavior  
- **Technical Validation** – sanity-checking workflows, wording, and expectations against how the system actually works  

Deliverables can include:

- Cleaned-up user guides and quick-start sheets  
- Annotated PDFs with comments and recommendations  
- Draft content for websites, onboarding emails, or internal training material  

The result: **less frustration**, **fewer support calls**, and **more trust** in your product or service.

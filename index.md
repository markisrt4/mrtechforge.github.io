  <!-- INTEGRITY / FAITH CALLOUT -->
  <section class="home-integrity">
    <h2>Forged With Integrity</h2>
    <p>
      M.R. TechForge is built on the belief that technology should serve people,
      not the other way around. That means honest recommendations, clear expectations,
      and work that reflects faith-driven integrity — even when no one is looking.

<div class="faq-container">

## **Why “TechForge”?**
<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>
Because good technology should be built with intention.  
Also because “Mark Build You Tech Things” didn’t test well  
</details>

---

## **Does Mark like Microsoft Windows?**
<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>
Is that like asking if I like the blue-screen of death?  Let's just say ive been hurt before.  By Windows. A LOT.

## **What’s better — Android or iPhone?**
<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>
I’m an Android guy.  
I like freedom, customization, and buttons that don’t yell at me.  
But if you use an iPhone, just be ok with the fact that an angel loses it's wings.
</details>

---

## **Will Mark work for coffee?**
<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>
Coffee? Possibly.  
But Mountain Dew + Cheetos?  
Let's talk.
</details>

---

## **Do I actually like people??**
<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>
Believe it or not — yes!  
I’m an engineer, so here’s a fun bit of trivia:

**Q:** How can you tell the difference between an introverted and an extroverted engineer?  
**A:** The introvert looks at *his own* shoes while talking.  
The extrovert looks at *your* shoes.

But helping folks is literally why M.R. TechForge exists — people matter, and I’m here for them.

Linux is dependable, logical, and free!  It's written by a bunch of cool nerds like me.

<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>
No judgment — but I *will* lovingly guide you away from “password123,”. I'm a lit nicer than the bad guys.
</details>

## **Can you fix my printer?**
<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

But every time I fix a printer, I die a little inside.
</details>

---

## **Why do you like computers?**
<details><summary>Click to expand</summary>

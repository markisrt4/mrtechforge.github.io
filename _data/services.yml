  faq:
    - q: "Do I need a new router?"
      a: "Not always. We can use your existing router if it supports the security and network features required. If it doesn’t, we’ll recommend a few vetted options or design a sidecar approach that works alongside ISP equipment."
    - q: "Do you store or access my data?"
      a: "No. MRTF does not store customer data, access files, or hold encryption keys. We design and configure storage and backup systems so you retain full ownership and control."
    - q: "Is this the same as a consumer VPN?"
      a: "No. Secure Remote Access is about safely reaching your own network when you’re away. It’s not a ‘privacy VPN subscription.’"
    - q: "What devices are protected by Network-Wide Protection?"
      a: "Everything on your network — phones, laptops, tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices — without installing software on each one."
    - q: "Do you provide 24/7 emergency support?"
      a: "Not by default. Managed Network Care can include priority support expectations, but MRTF does not advertise 24/7 on-call service unless explicitly agreed."
    - q: "What if I need new hardware like cables or storage drives?"
      a: "We can validate your existing equipment, recommend compatible hardware for you to purchase directly, or optionally supply hardware with clear itemization — no proprietary lock-in."

  faq:
    - q: Do I need a new router?
      a: >-
        Not always. We can use your existing router if it supports the security and network features required.
        If it doesn’t, we’ll recommend a few vetted options or design a sidecar approach that works alongside ISP equipment.
    - q: Do you store or access my data?
      a: >-
        No. MRTF does not store customer data, access files, or hold encryption keys.
        We design and configure storage and backup systems so you retain full ownership and control.
    - q: Is this the same as a consumer VPN?
      a: >-
        No. Secure Remote Access is about safely reaching your own network when you’re away.
        It’s not a ‘privacy VPN subscription.’
    - q: What devices are protected by Network-Wide Protection?
      a: >-
        Everything on your network — phones, laptops, tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices — without installing software on each one.
    - q: Do you provide 24/7 emergency support?
      a: >-
        Not by default. Managed Network Care can include clearer response expectations,
        but MRTF does not advertise 24/7 on-call service unless explicitly agreed.
    - q: What if I need new hardware like cables or storage drives?
      a: >-
        We can validate your existing equipment, recommend compatible hardware for you to purchase directly,
        or optionally supply hardware with clear itemization — no proprietary lock-in.

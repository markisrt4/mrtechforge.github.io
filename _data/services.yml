  faq:
  - q: "Do I need a new router?"
    a: "Not always. We can use your existing router if it supports the security and network features required. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll recommend a few vetted options or design a sidecar approach that works alongside ISP equipment."
  - q: "Do you store or access my data?"
    a: "No. MRTF does not store customer data, access files, or hold encryption keys. We design and configure storage and backup systems so you retain full ownership and control."
  - q: "Is this the same as a consumer VPN?"
    a: "No. Secure Remote Access is about safely reaching your own network when you\u2019re away. It\u2019s not a \u2018privacy VPN subscription.\u2019"
  - q: "What devices are protected by Network-Wide Protection?"
    a: "Everything on your network \u2014 phones, laptops, tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices \u2014 without installing software on each one."
  - q: "Do you provide 24/7 emergency support?"
    a: "Not by default. Managed Network Care can include clearer response expectations, but MRTF does not advertise 24/7 on-call service unless explicitly agreed."
  - q: "What if I need new hardware like cables or storage drives?"
    a: "We can validate your existing equipment, recommend compatible hardware for you to purchase directly, or optionally supply hardware with clear itemization \u2014 no proprietary lock-in."

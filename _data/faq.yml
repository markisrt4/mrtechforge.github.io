  # FUN

  - category: fun
    q: "Why “TechForge”?"
    a: "Because good technology should be built with intention. Also because “Mark Build You Tech Things” didn’t test well."
    tags: ["fun", "brand"]

  - category: fun
    q: "Does Mark like Microsoft Windows?"
    a: "Is that like asking if I enjoy the blue-screen of death? Let’s just say I’ve been hurt before. By Windows. A LOT."

  - category: fun
    q: "What’s better — Android or iPhone?"
    a: "I’m an Android guy. I like freedom, customization, and buttons that don’t yell at me. But if you use an iPhone, just be okay with the fact that an angel loses its wings."
    tags: ["fun", "mobile"]

  - category: fun
    q: "Will Mark work for coffee?"
    a: "Coffee? Possibly. But Mountain Dew + Cheetos? Let’s talk."
    tags: ["fun"]

  - category: fun
    q: "Do I actually like people??"
    a: "Believe it or not — yes! I’m an engineer, so here’s a fun bit of trivia: Q: How can you tell the difference between an introverted and an extroverted engineer? A: The introvert looks at his own shoes while talking. The extrovert looks at your shoes. But helping folks is literally why M.R. TechForge exists — people matter, and I’m here for them."

    tags: ["fun", "linux"]

    tags: ["fun", "security"]

    a: "I can. But every time I fix a printer, I die a little inside."
    tags: ["fun"]

  - category: fun
    q: "Why do you like computers?"
    a: "As a dad, I appreciate that computers don’t hit, scream, or call me names. They just quietly crash — which honestly feels refreshing."

    a: "Of course! I’ll guide you gently. You’ll thank me later."

  # FORGE SECURE NETWORK (moved from services.yml)
  # ---------------------------
  - category: secure-network
    q: "Do I need a new router?"
    a: "Not always. We can use your existing router if it supports the security and network features required. If it doesn’t, I’ll recommend vetted options or design a sidecar approach that works alongside ISP equipment."
    tags: ["secure-network"]

  - category: secure-network
    q: "Do you store or access my data?"
    a: "No. I do not store customer data, access files, or hold encryption keys. I design and configure storage and backup systems so you retain full ownership and control."
    tags: ["secure-network", "privacy"]

  - category: secure-network
    q: "Is this the same as a consumer VPN?"
    a: "No. Secure Remote Access is about safely reaching your own network when you’re away. It’s not a “privacy VPN subscription.”"
    tags: ["secure-network"]

  - category: secure-network
    q: "What devices are protected by Network-Wide Protection?"
    a: "Everything on your network — phones, laptops, tablets, smart TVs, and IoT devices — without installing software on each one."
    tags: ["secure-network"]

  - category: secure-network
    q: "Do you provide 24/7 emergency support?"
    a: "Not by default. Managed Network Care can include priority support expectations, but I do not advertise 24/7 on-call service unless explicitly agreed."
    tags: ["secure-network"]

  - category: secure-network
    q: "What if I need new hardware like cables or storage drives?"
    a: "I can validate your existing equipment, recommend compatible hardware for you to purchase directly, or optionally supply hardware with clear itemization — no proprietary lock-in."

  # FORGE SECURE NETWORK (moved from managed_phone_line.md)
  # ---------------------------

  - category: managed-phone-text
    q: "Are you a phone carrier?"
    a: "No. M.R. TechForge is not a phone carrier. We design and manage communication systems using modern phone and messaging platforms, but we are not selling minutes, data plans, or telecom contracts."
    tags: ["managed-phone-text", "communication"]

  - category: managed-phone-text
    q: "Can I make outgoing calls from this number?"
    a: "Yes. Outgoing calling can be enabled so calls display your managed number as the caller ID. This is configured intentionally based on your needs."
    tags: ["managed-phone-text", "communication"]

  - category: managed-phone-text
    q: "Do I need special hardware?"
    a: "No. Most clients use mobile or desktop apps. Desk phones or traditional handsets can be supported if desired, but no hardware is required to get started."
    tags: ["managed-phone-text", "communication"]

  - category: managed-phone-text
    q: "Is this a replacement for my personal phone?"
    a: "Not necessarily. Many clients use this as a separate, public-facing number while keeping their personal number private."

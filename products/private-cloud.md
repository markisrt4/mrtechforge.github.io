# Private Cloud & VPN Services  
### Keep your business files close — and your access secure.

Most small businesses don’t actually want “everything in the cloud.”  
They just want their important files to be:

- easy to get to  
- safe from ransomware and random hacks  
- accessible for remote staff  
- not tied to a single dusty office PC  

M.R. TechForge (MRTF) builds **small-business private cloud nodes**:  
on-prem mini-servers with secure VPN access and sane backup plans.

## <span class="block-heading">Why This Matters</span>

<div class="forge-card">
You shouldn’t have to choose between:

- **“Somewhere on the internet”** – cloud accounts, mystery storage, confusing sharing, and breach headlines  
- **“Somewhere in the office”** – a single PC under a desk that nobody wants to touch  

A private cloud node gives you a third option:

- Your data lives on hardware **you** own, inside **your** building  
- Remote access happens over an encrypted VPN, not random open ports  
- Nightly backups land on a separate drive that you can plug into any Windows PC in an emergency  

You stay in control — without becoming your own IT department.

# <span class="block-heading">How It Works</span>

<div class="forge-card">
1. <strong>We talk</strong> about how your team works today and where your files live now.  
2. <strong>I design a plan</strong> for a private cloud node that fits your size, risk level, and budget.  
3. <strong>We deploy</strong> the node on-site (or remotely where possible) and migrate your initial data.  
4. <strong>We test together</strong> – shared folders, VPN access, and backups.  
5. <strong>Ongoing support</strong> keeps your system patched, backed up, and ready for bad days you hopefully never see.

# 💔 Life Without Google  
### *A Practical, Slightly Dramatic Guide to Breaking Up With Big G*

Congratulations, brave traveler.  
You’ve arrived at the **Digital Security & Best Practices** section —  
and today we’re talking about the one breakup everyone thinks about  
but few ever actually go through:

**Leaving Google.**

Look, using Google isn’t a moral failure.  
But giving one company your email, your contacts, your schedule, your photos,  
your location history, your search history, your browser, your documents,  
and your phone…  

Yeah.  
That’s not a relationship.  
That’s *codependence*.

This guide isn’t about paranoia.  
It’s about **digital hygiene**, **choice**, and **taking back control**  
without throwing your Android phone into a lake.

Let’s begin.

# 🧭 Why Break Up At All?

Google’s services are powerful, convenient, and free —  
but the cost isn’t money.  
It’s data.

Every service you use feeds into a massive profile that predicts:

- what you’ll click  
- what you’ll buy  
- what you’ll watch  
- where you go  
- what you believe  
- even what mood you’re in  

This isn’t tinfoil hat stuff —  
it’s literally their business model.

Breaking up doesn’t mean disappearing.  
It means **reducing the precision of that profile**  
and choosing tools that respect your privacy.

# 🔧 What This Guide Covers

- How to reduce reliance on Google services  
- How to transition to privacy-respecting alternatives  
- Practical tools that work on Android *without breaking anything*  
- How to move your contacts, messages, and files  
- A living comparison table of alternatives you can update anytime  

This is a **gentle off-ramp**, not a leap into the void.

# 📦 Step 1: Replace the Worst Offenders

Here are the top Google services people swap out first —  
and what you can use instead.

- **Email:** Proton Mail or PrivateEmail  
- **Search:** DuckDuckGo or Brave Search  
- **Maps:** Organic Maps / Magic Earth  
- **Browser:** Firefox or Brave  
- **Photos:** Immich (self-hosted) or Simple Gallery Pro  
- **Drive:** Nextcloud or Proton Drive  
- **Keyboard:** AnySoftKeyboard / FlorisBoard  

This alone dramatically reduces data collection.

# ☎️ Step 2: Contacts, Messages & Identity Stuff

These are usually the messy parts, so here’s the clean version:

### **Contacts**
Use:
- **DAVx⁵ + Mailbox.org / FastMail / Nextcloud**, or  
- **Proton Contacts** (if you're all-in on Proton)

Export from Google → import → sync with DAVx⁵.  
Done.

### **Messages**
Google Messages = RCS = Google servers.

Most privacy-conscious users split things:

- **Signal** for real conversations  
- **Simple SMS / Textra** for legacy SMS  

It’s the perfect balance of privacy and practicality.

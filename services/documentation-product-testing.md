    <p>
      Clarity is the difference between frustration and confidence.
      We bridge the gap between the people who <em>build</em> technology and the people who <em>use</em> it —
      through professional documentation, usability testing, and clear communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll get deliverables that reduce support load, improve onboarding, and make your product feel as polished as it truly is.

      Below are examples of turning confusing instructions into clear, confidence-building guidance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="examples-section">

    <div class="example-card">
      <h3>📘 Example 1 — Product Assembly Instructions</h3>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Original Translation:</strong><br>
        "Please fix screw until tight feeling coming, not too much or broken happiness will happen.
        Use tool but not force like angry."
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="forge-fixed">
        <strong>Rewritten for Clarity:</strong><br>
        "Tighten the screw until snug—do not overtighten, as this may damage the part.
        Use a screwdriver with steady pressure; excessive force is not required."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="result">
        Result: Replaced unclear phrasing with concise, professional assembly guidance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-card">
      <h3>🔋 Example 2 — Power &amp; Safety Information</h3>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Original Translation:</strong><br>
        "Use adaptor suitable voltage or product will smoke and death will come shortly.
        Please to avoid shorting joy and sadness."
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="forge-fixed">
        <strong>Rewritten for Clarity:</strong><br>
        "Use only the power adapter specified for this product’s voltage range.
        Using the wrong adapter may cause damage or overheating.
        Keep connectors dry to prevent short circuits."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="result">
        Result: Replaced alarming language with precise safety guidance users can trust.

      MRTF tests your product the way customers actually use it — looking for friction,
      confusion, and edge cases before they become support tickets or bad reviews.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Usability and “first-time user” testing</li>
      <li>Setup and onboarding validation</li>
      <li>Bug capture with clear reproduction steps</li>
      <li>Workflow and messaging improvements</li>
      <li>Risk review for common failure points</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Outcome:</strong> fewer surprises after launch and better customer experience.

## 🔧 What We Do

Clarity is the difference between frustration and confidence.  
We help bridge the gap between the people who *build* technology and the people who *use* it — through professional documentation, usability testing, and clear communication.

Our work includes:

- **Documentation Overhaul**  
  We rewrite confusing manuals, instructions, procedures, and workflows into clear, accurate, user-friendly guides.

- **Usability & Product Testing**  
  We test devices and systems like real users do — identifying where documentation fails to match real behavior.

- **Technical Validation**  
  We ensure specifications, diagrams, and processes are consistent and technically correct.

- **Deliverables That Actually Help**  
  Annotated PDFs, corrected manuals, rewritten help guides, and test findings — all designed to reduce frustration and build trust.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Good documentation is *part of the product*, not an afterthought.

With a background in **engineering, embedded systems, and technical communication**, we help organizations deliver documentation that makes users confident, not confused.

Clear communication leads to:
- Higher user satisfaction  
- Fewer support requests  
- Better onboarding  
- Stronger perception of product quality

## 🧾 Professional Writing Example

A published example of Mark’s technical writing:

**[Deterministic & Modular Architecture for Embedded Vehicle Systems — NDIA (2023)](https://www.mobilityengineeringtech.com/component/content/article/50043-deterministic-and-modular-architecture-for-embedded-vehicle-systems)**

> Demonstrates Mark’s experience with modular embedded design, deterministic networking, and standards-based architectures — the same skills applied to every documentation project.

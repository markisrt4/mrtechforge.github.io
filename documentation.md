  <h2>🧩 Example Projects & Real-World Rewrites</h2>
  <p>
    Each example is <strong>inspired by real-world product manuals</strong>—rewritten to
    demonstrate our approach to clarity, accuracy, and tone. The goal is to show how clear,
    professional documentation can transform the user experience.

  <!-- Example 1 -->
  <div class="example-card">
    <h3>📘 Example 1 — Product Assembly Instructions</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Original Translation:</strong><br>
      "Please fix screw until tight feeling coming, not too much or broken happiness will happen.
      Use tool but not force like angry."
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="forge-fixed">
      <strong>Rewritten for Clarity:</strong><br>
      "Tighten the screw until snug—do not overtighten, as this may damage the part.
      Use a screwdriver with steady pressure; there’s no need to force it."
    </blockquote>
    <p class="result">
      Result: Removed emotional language and replaced it with clear, professional assembly
      phrasing while keeping the friendly tone.
